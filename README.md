# Code-and-Tutorials-Saving
In this repository, I will put code I often use, as well as links to code, tutorials, and usefull courses. <br>
I *hopefully* will add folders with collections of R code and python code for useful code, which I use regularly, or *should* use regularly... <br>
Also, I will hopefully add some more links for useful repositories and other useful code and tutorials.


### links to other repositories I might find usefull
- [Python-Notebooks by mithun](https://mithun162001.github.io/Python-Notebooks/)
- [NotebookExplore](https://github.com/notebookexplore/NotebookExplore)

  *more to be added soon*
